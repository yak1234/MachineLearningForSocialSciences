This project analyzes COVID-19 data for European countries, with an additional feature indicating whether a Radical Right Party is in power for each country.

The inspiration for this project comes from the paper "Victims of the Pandemic? European Far-Right Parties and COVID-19" by Cas Mudde and Jakub Wondreys[1]. In their paper, they dispute the claim that countries with Radical Right Parties in power have handled the pandemic worse than other parties.

However, the paper only considered total COVID-19 deaths and whether a Radical Right Party was in power. This project takes a more deductive approach by adding the presence of a Radical Right Party in power as an additional feature alongside other features from the Our World In Data dataset, such as GDP, median age, and HDI. This will allow us to determine if having a Radical Right Party in power has a significant effect on COVID-19 deaths, while controlling for other relevant factors[1].

The dependent variable is the number of total COVID-19 deaths. This project remains a supervised learning problem with the target variable being total COVID-19 deaths.
