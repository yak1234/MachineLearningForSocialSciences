Motivation
This Project looks at Covid Data for European Countries. An additional feature , that this project will have in our models is whether a Radical Right Party is in Power for European countries.

The idea for this project comes from a paper called "Victims of the Pandemic? European Far-Right Parties and COVID-19" by Cas Mudde and Jakub Wondreys. In this paper, they dispute that countires with Radical Right Parties in Power, have handled the pandemic worse than other parties.

However, that paper only looked at Total Covid Deaths and if a Radical Right Party was in Power. This project will take a more deductive approach and simply add as an additional feature if a Radical Right Power was in Power. This will allow us to see if the Radical Right Party in Power has a significant effect on the Covid Deaths. The paper did not look at additional features from the Our World In Data such as GDP,median age and HDI.

The Dependent variable is Number of Total Covid Deaths. This project will simply add one additonal feature on top of the features already present in the Our World In Data. The project will still be Suprivsed Learning problem with the Target Variable being Total Covid Deaths.

The following countries that will be studied are 'Austria', 'Belgium', 'Croatia', 'Czech Republic', 'Denmark', 'Finland', 'France', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'Bulgaria', 'Estonia', 'Slovakia', 'Slovenia', 'Hungary', 'Poland'.
